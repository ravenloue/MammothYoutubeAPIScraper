## Overview

This is a pretty simple YouTube API scraper that will grab links, thumbnails and descriptions based on user searches. This is based on the tutorial by Mammoth Interactive, but I added the functionality to include channels

### The idea

- Create a YouTube API Scraper
  - Build the HTML base
  - Create an API key for YouTube
  - Build functionality to allow users to search for videos and channels on YouTube

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- HTML
- Google APIs
- JSitor

### What I learned

Many thanks to Mammoth Interactive for their tutorial for this process. Up until now I hadn't really handled APIs at all, and now I feel at least confident with the YouTube API. I want to find more ways to be able to utilize this and other APIs in the future. 

### Continued development

- January 16, 2023
  - I finished the tutorial. I added on the ability for the search to populate channels. The next step is to get playlists to work.
